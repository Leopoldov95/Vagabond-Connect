- if post belongs to user. add triple dot to add delete function or edit
- see how to handle likes 
- make sure that the post component is dynamic, will only show what is needed based if feed or Profile

---- Profile Components and features ----
- follower count
- posts
- countrys visited
- when user creation or editing, use the same country selector component and store the index
- when clicking mail or notification on navbar, show overlay menu


-- Handling Country List --
- CHANGED COUNTRY LIST TO OBJECT AND USING KEYS AS IDENTIFIERS, REDO ALL AVOUNTRY INPUTS
- favorite/visited country list is to be stored on users database
- when editing, all changes made are local only, ONLY submit/change if user saves changes
- if user cancels, simply ignore all changes OR revert to orignal data

- In the future, make sure to add pagination/maximum post data in order to have infinite scroll/ performance management
- handle empty/no profile pic

- may want to change jwt name as well as localstorage name ('profile') is too generic
- later on, may want to test profile image upload tool

- For user edit, may not need to pass user props for id, get value from params instead (user.userId)

- 12/13/21 - To do
- will want to figure out a method to retrieve "load more" on posts and users
- set page to go to top on load/url change
- comments = need to render new comment img correctly
- later on, will want to handle offline errors
- When updating a post, either by patch or put, must provide params, better practive // REVIEW API ROUTES (1 issue)
- might want pop up when unfollowing a user
- create snackbar for the following actions: user login, user sign up, post creation, post edit, post deletion
- if profile user has privacy set to private, hide unless user is a follower
- For fetching users posts for their profile page, handle filter logic on the backend (such as sorting them)
- fix render issue when showing guest users (such as showing a load circle on profile pic and background image)
- handle main page post filter by continent
- implement a way to message other users (only those who you follow) 
- implement notifications 
** Later on, create a univeral style sheet that contains classes that gt used across multiple pages and compnents (such as buttons)
