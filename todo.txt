* 11/21 - Mainly done with the frontend, need to start adding backend features
- if no user is logged in, proceed to AUTH page and ask for credentials, users can proceed to continue as guest if they wish
- First check whether or not a user is logged in, if not, then guest CANNOT do the following:
    - like a Post
    - create a comment 
    - follow a user
    - view profile (maybe redirect?)

- later on, need to make navbar searchbar own component to look for users
- add privacy seeting to allow only followers to see profile
- users can change this in setting
- users can accept or deny follw requests (based on privacy settings)
- users can modify/delete own comments
- when showing comments, only show like 3 lines before adding ... to show the entire comment

// BIGGEST CHALLENGES
- how to maintane logged in user across session and plly user data to multiple pages
- uploading images to db


//// AFTER I'M FINISHED /////
- when creating the readme, explain why I used the following technologies:
    - Next.js
    - Typescript
    - Material UI
    - SQL database
    - JWT tokens and bcrypt for authentication
