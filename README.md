## General Info
This is a Full-Stack Social Media website where a user can have an account, create a post and manage it, follow and view other users, comment on posts, and personalise their profile page. All information is stored in a Mongo database and the frontend was created using React and Typescript.

## Usage
Simply click on the demo link provided.
If you wish to download the code and use it, you must first download or clone the repo.
If you want to use your own MongoDb Atlas server, you must configure the .env file with your MongoDB database and then run ```npm install ``` to install the dependencies and then start the server with ```npm start ```

If you just want to use the client then simply go to the client folder, run ```npm install ``` to install the dependencies and then start the client with ```npm start ```

* Mongo DB

## Challenges 
I wanted to create a web application that heavily used a backend compared to my previous projects. A social media website was an excellent choice in order to fully understand the fundamentals of HTTP requests, managing and updating values in a database, and knowing how to make a flow between the frontend and the backend.

In addition to the aforementioned goals, I used Typescript in this project which was an additional challenge, although far from perfect, I learned the values of having types in order to prevent unexpected behavior as well as provide better documentation for my code.

An amazing library I used for the frontend was MaterialUI, which is a popular React component library. It was a bit tricky to use at first, but once I got the hang of it as well as its features, I was able to really build beautiful components for my website.

## What I Learned
This project was a major step-up from previous websites I have created. While I had dabbled in the backend, the use was fairly minimal. With this project I learned how to structure a full-stack applicaion and manage the backend code. I also gained an appreciation for state management tools such as Redux to avoid having too many states floating around.

## Future Enhancemants
I am currently working on adding th following enhancements to the web application.
* Notifications
* Messaging
* UI improvements
